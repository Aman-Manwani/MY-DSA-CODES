idea behind the question is to find the distance along the lca so first find out the level of both the nodes of which you have to find the distance between,and then find the level of the lca of the two nodes and apply the formula level(node1)+level(node2)-2*level(lca); resultant will be you your shortest path between the two nodes  
its so easy try to get answer easily;
